# SemanticHTML

### 🗺 The Task
For this task, you will be given a set of User Specifications/Business Requirements.
👉 Your job is to build an HTML page following these user specifications/business requirements using Semantic HTML . The specifications are deliberately vague - it’s your job to identify which HTML elements would be the most appropriate to use!
👉 The submission we are looking for is just an .html file in a GitHub repository
  
❗️Note: This task is about Semantic HTML only. You do NOT need to use any CSS.
  
❗️Note: You don’t need to make the whole page function! It’s okay if the nav bars don’t work, and you don’t have to setup a HTTP server to serve the HTML or handle navigations or anything like that.
   
#### 💡 If you want to use this assignment as an excuse to setup a very simple development HTTP server and have your HTML pages navigate to each other correctly, then have fun! But it is NOT required.
   
### 🧠 Think about:
#### Correct usage of Semantic HTML - can you justify your choice of HTML tags and attributes? Are you using semantic/appropriate elements e.g. instead of wrapping everything in lots of divs, could there be a better element to use like a `<section>` or `<article>` tag?
 - I have used semantic tags
#### Have you tested your code in any way (e.g. the W3C MarkUp Validator https://validator.w3.org/#validate_by_input and/or Google Chromes Lighthouse)? 
- I tested this code using the HTML Validator
#### Could you navigate your page without using a mouse? 
- Yes, I can navigate this page just usong a keyboard
#### Have you used alt tags? What description have you chosen to use (if any at all) and why? 
- I have used an `<alt>` tag so that visually-impaired users can appreciate the intention iof the image, which is about accessibility.
